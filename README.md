 keymaps and config files for various keyboards

This is not a copy of QMK, I am just using their folder structure to store my files.  
If you wish to use any of my files then please copy them into your own copy of QMK.  

In the model directory for each board I have put a ready to flash file if you do not
wish to make any changes.  These will be subject to any changes I hade made in the 
config files.  

For the BM40 I am using the board maintainers latest commits, however I have changed 
some settings.  I am not supporting this firmware and as far as I am aware it has not 
been merged into the master yet.  So check out rgoulter's fork for the default rev2
firmware.
